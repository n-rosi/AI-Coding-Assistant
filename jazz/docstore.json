European harmony, African rhythmic rituals,\nspirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance\nmusic. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as\na major form of musical expression in traditional and\npopular music. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue\nnotes, complex chords, call and response vocals,\npolyrhythms and improvisation.\nAs jazz spread around the world, it drew on national,\nregional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to\ndifferent styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early\n1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French\nquadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective\npolyphonic improvisation. However, jazz did not begin as\na single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere.[1]\nIn the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands,\nKansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational\nstyle), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette\nwaltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the\n1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward\na more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played\nat faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation.\nCool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing\ncalmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.[2]\nThe mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which\nintroduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and\nblues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and\npiano. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the\nmode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure\nand improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored\nplaying without regular meter, beat and formal structures.\nJazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early\n1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's\nrhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage\nsound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz\nfusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering\nsignificant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in\nthe 21st century, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3380, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe6d65d4-db05-468d-89f0-778ebbc351c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe6d65d4-db05-468d-89f0-778ebbc351c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae7f7178-d8cc-4bf6-a6c5-29e550254fb9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "6089501e29aa6773d280085b68b2299ff548f8bcb51af046dc21c307a405b8c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "punk jazz \u00b7 ska jazz \u00b7 smooth jazz \u00b7\nswing revival \u00b7 Western swing \u00b7 world fusion\nRegional scenes\nRegional scenes\nAustralia \u00b7 Armenia \u00b7 Azerbaijan \u00b7 Balkans\n(Bulgaria) \u00b7 Baltimore \u00b7 Belgium \u00b7 Brazil \u00b7\nCanada \u00b7 Chicago \u00b7 Cuba \u00b7 Denmark \u00b7 France \u00b7\nGermany \u00b7 Haiti \u00b7 India \u00b7 Iran \u00b7 Italy \u00b7 Japan \u00b7\nKansas City \u00b7 Malawi \u00b7 Mexico \u00b7 Netherlands \u00b7\nNew Orleans \u00b7 New York City \u00b7 Poland \u00b7\nSouth Africa (Cape jazz) \u00b7 Spain \u00b7 Sweden \u00b7 UK\n\u00b7 U.S. West Coast \u00b7 Washington, D.C.\nOther topics\nJazz clubs \u00b7 Jazz standard \u00b7 Jazz (word)\n 2024 in jazz\nAmerican jazz composer, lyricist,\nand pianist Eubie Blake made an\nearly contribution to the genre's\netymology.\nThe origin of the word jazz has resulted in considerable\nresearch, and its history is well documented. It is believed\nto be related to jasm, a slang term dating back to 1860\nmeaning 'pep, energy'.[3][4] The earliest written record of\nthe word is in a 1912 article in the Los Angeles Times in\nwhich a minor league baseball pitcher described a pitch\nwhich he called a 'jazz ball' \"because it wobbles and you\nsimply can't do anything with it\".[3][4]\nThe use of the word in a musical context was documented\nas early as 1915 in the Chicago Daily Tribune.[4][5] Its first\ndocumented use in a musical context in New Orleans was\nin a November 14, 1916, Times-Picayune article about \"jas\nbands\".[6] In an interview with National Public Radio,\nmusician Eubie Blake offered his recollections of the slang\nconnotations of the term, saying: \"When Broadway picked it up, they\ncalled it 'J-A-Z-Z'. It wasn't called that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S'. That was\ndirty, and if you knew what it was, you wouldn't say it in front of\nladies.\"[7] The American Dialect Society named it the Word of the 20th\nCentury.[8]\nJazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of music\nspanning a period of over 100 years, from ragtime to rock-infused fusion.\nAttempts have been made to define jazz from the perspective of other\nmusical traditions, such as European music history or African music. But\ncritic Joachim-Ernst Berendt argues that its terms of reference and its\ndefinition should be broader,[9] defining jazz as a \"form of art music\nwhich originated in the United States through the confrontation of the\nNegro with European music\"[10] and arguing that it differs from\nEuropean music in that jazz has a \"special relationship to time defined as\n'swing'\". Jazz involves \"a spontaneity and vitality of musical production\nin which improvisation plays a role\" and contains a \"sonority and manner\nof phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician\".[9]\nA broader definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed by Travis Jackson: \"it is\nmusic that includes qualities such as swing, improvising, group interaction, developing an 'individual voice',\nand being open to different musical possibilities\".[11] Krin Gibbard argued that \"jazz is a construct\" which\ndesignates \"a number of musics with enough in common to be understood as part of a coherent tradition\".[12]\nDuke Ellington, one of jazz's most famous figures, said, \"It's all music.\"[13]\nEtymology and definition\nElements\nImprovisation", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3163, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c03c5eeb-c826-4540-85d8-cf9c621cddce": {"__data__": {"id_": "c03c5eeb-c826-4540-85d8-cf9c621cddce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eaa7d210-0e36-4f62-817f-134493112825", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "ef6af12501fd1c0277c6b9af7081ac9b8c67bc6e84358bcafb00831d65b63b8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Albert Gleizes, 1915, Composition\nfor \"Jazz\" from the Solomon R.\nGuggenheim Museum, New York\nAlthough jazz is considered difficult to define, in part because it\ncontains many subgenres, improvisation is one of its defining\nelements. The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence\nof earlier forms of music such as blues, a form of folk music which\narose in part from the work songs and field hollers of African-\nAmerican slaves on plantations. These work songs were commonly\nstructured around a repetitive call-and-response pattern, but early\nblues was also improvisational. Classical music performance is\nevaluated more by its fidelity to the musical score, with less attention\ngiven to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment. The\nclassical performer's goal is to play the composition as it was written.\nIn contrast, jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction\nand collaboration, placing less value on the contribution of the\ncomposer, if there is one, and more on the performer.[14] The jazz\nperformer interprets a tune in individual ways, never playing the same\ncomposition twice. Depending on the performer's mood, experience, and interaction with band members or\naudience members, the performer may change melodies, harmonies, and time signatures.[15]\nIn early Dixieland, a.k.a. New Orleans jazz, performers took turns playing melodies and improvising\ncountermelodies. In the swing era of the 1920s\u201340s, big bands relied more on arrangements which were\nwritten or learned by ear and memorized. Soloists improvised within these arrangements. In the bebop era of\nthe 1940s, big bands gave way to small groups and minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated\nbriefly at the beginning and most of the piece was improvised. Modal jazz abandoned chord progressions to\nallow musicians to improvise even more. In many forms of jazz, a soloist is supported by a rhythm section of\none or more chordal instruments (piano, guitar), double bass, and drums. The rhythm section plays chords\nand rhythms that outline the composition structure and complement the soloist.[16] In avant-garde and free\njazz, the separation of soloist and band is reduced, and there is license, or even a requirement, for the\nabandoning of chords, scales, and meters.\nSince the emergence of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music\nhave been criticized. According to Bruce Johnson, there has always been a \"tension between jazz as a\ncommercial music and an art form\".[11] Regarding the Dixieland jazz revival of the 1940s, Black musicians\nrejected it as being shallow nostalgia entertainment for white audiences.[17][18] On the other hand, traditional\njazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop, free jazz, and jazz fusion as forms of debasement and betrayal. An\nalternative view is that jazz can absorb and transform diverse musical styles.[19] By avoiding the creation of\nnorms, jazz allows avant-garde styles to emerge.[11]\nFor some African Americans, jazz has drawn attention to African-American contributions to culture and\nhistory. For others, jazz is a reminder of \"an oppressive and racist society and restrictions on their artistic\nvisions\".[20] Amiri Baraka argues that there is a \"white jazz\" genre that expresses whiteness.[21] White jazz\nmusicians appeared in the Midwest and in other areas throughout the U.S. Papa Jack Laine, who ran the\nTraditionalism\nDiversity in jazz\nJazz and race", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3451, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3924b02f-0392-4f87-8e56-e02258b88a82": {"__data__": {"id_": "3924b02f-0392-4f87-8e56-e02258b88a82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32455eb3-c96d-49fb-b859-7cdca746e10d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "4ae24acb70c8c3df856b234a86f9bf16fd3723381adadcba0d8fbbba615d265c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Ethel Waters sang \"Stormy\nWeather\" at the Cotton Club.\nAl Jolson in 1929\nReliance band in New Orleans in the 1910s, was called \"the father of white jazz\".[22] The Original Dixieland\nJazz Band, whose members were white, were the first jazz group to record, and Bix Beiderbecke was one of\nthe most prominent jazz soloists of the 1920s.[23] The Chicago Style was developed by white musicians such\nas Eddie Condon, Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland, and Dave Tough. Others from Chicago such as Benny\nGoodman and Gene Krupa became leading members of swing during the 1930s.[24] Many bands included\nboth Black and white musicians. These musicians helped change attitudes toward race in the U.S.[25]\nFemale jazz performers and composers have contributed to jazz throughout\nits history. Although Betty Carter, Ella Fitzgerald, Adelaide Hall, Billie\nHoliday, Peggy Lee, Abbey Lincoln, Anita O'Day, Dinah Washington, and\nEthel Waters were recognized for their vocal talent, less familiar were\nbandleaders, composers, and instrumentalists such as pianist Lil Hardin\nArmstrong, trumpeter Valaida Snow, and songwriters Irene Higginbotham\nand Dorothy Fields. Women began playing instruments in jazz in the early\n1920s, drawing particular recognition on piano.[26]\nWhen male jazz musicians were drafted during World War II, many all-\nfemale bands replaced them.[26] The International Sweethearts of Rhythm,\nwhich was founded in 1937, was a popular band that became the first all-\nfemale integrated band in the U.S. and the first to travel with the USO,\ntouring Europe in 1945. Women were members of the big bands of Woody Herman and Gerald Wilson.\nBeginning in the 1950s, many women jazz instrumentalists were prominent, some sustaining long careers.\nSome of the most distinctive improvisers, composers, and bandleaders in jazz have been women.[27]\nTrombonist Melba Liston is acknowledged as the first female horn player to work in major bands and to\nmake a real impact on jazz, not only as a musician but also as a respected composer and arranger, particularly\nthrough her collaborations with Randy Weston from the late 1950s into the 1990s.[28][29]\nJewish Americans played a significant role in jazz. As jazz spread, it\ndeveloped to encompass many different cultures, and the work of Jewish\ncomposers in Tin Pan Alley helped shape the many different sounds that jazz\ncame to incorporate.[30]\nJewish Americans were able to thrive in Jazz because of the probationary\nwhiteness that they were allotted at the time.[31] George Bornstein wrote that\nAfrican Americans were sympathetic to the plight of the Jewish American\nand vice versa. As disenfranchised minorities themselves, Jewish composers\nof popular music saw themselves as natural allies with African\nAmericans.[32]\nThe Jazz Singer with Al Jolson is one example of how Jewish Americans\nwere able to bring jazz, music that African Americans developed, into\npopular culture.[33] Benny Goodman was a vital Jewish American to the progression of Jazz. Goodman was\nthe leader of a racially integrated band named King of Swing. His jazz concert in the Carnegie Hall in 1938\nwas the first ever to be played there. The concert was described by Bruce Eder as \"the single most important\njazz or popular music concert in history\".[34]\nRoles of women\nJews in jazz", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3286, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0575bd9-38a1-48d2-8957-d82991e136d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0575bd9-38a1-48d2-8957-d82991e136d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a9cfd91e-407a-4ca2-93a0-edf126f81240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "38e580a2afa8dce8b67380ce81cbf90574bebb4d29059ce43c6a249bf162d7ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Dance in Congo Square in the late\n1700s, artist's conception by E.

It developed out of many forms of music, including\nblues, ragtime, European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and\ndance music.[38][39][40][41][42][43][44] It also incorporated interpretations of American and European classical\nmusic, entwined with African and slave folk songs and the influences of West African culture.[45] Its\ncomposition and style have changed many times throughout the years with each performer's personal\ninterpretation and improvisation, which is also one of the greatest appeals of the genre.[46]\nBy the 18th century, slaves in the New Orleans area gathered socially\nat a special market, in an area which later became known as Congo\nSquare, famous for its African dances.[47]\nBy 1866, the Atlantic slave trade had brought nearly 400,000 Africans\nto North America.[48] The slaves came largely from West Africa and\nthe greater Congo River basin and brought strong musical traditions\nwith them.[49] The African traditions primarily use a single-line\nmelody and call-and-response pattern, and the rhythms have a\ncounter-metric structure and reflect African speech patterns.[50]\nAn 1885 account says that they were making strange music (Creole)\non an equally strange variety of 'instruments'\u2014washboards, washtubs,\njugs, boxes beaten with sticks or bones and a drum made by stretching\nskin over a flour-barrel.[41][51]\nLavish festivals with African-based dances to drums were organized\non Sundays at Place Congo, or Congo Square, in New Orleans until\n1843.[52] There are historical accounts of other music and dance\ngatherings elsewhere in the southern United States.

However, as Gerhard Kubik points out, whereas the\nspirituals are homophonic, rural blues and early jazz \"was largely based on concepts of heterophony\".[55]\nDuring the early 19th century an increasing number of black\nmusicians learned to play European instruments, particularly the\nviolin, which they used to parody European dance music in their own\ncakewalk dances. In turn, European American minstrel show\nperformers in blackface popularized the music internationally,\ncombining syncopation with European harmonic accompaniment. In\nthe mid-1800s the white New Orleans composer Louis Moreau\nGottschalk adapted slave rhythms and melodies from Cuba and other\nCaribbean islands into piano salon music. New Orleans was the main\nnexus between the Afro-Caribbean and African American cultures.\nThe Black Codes outlawed drumming by slaves, which meant that\nAfrican drumming traditions were not preserved in North America, unlike in Cuba, Haiti, and elsewhere in\nthe Caribbean. African-based rhythmic patterns were retained in the United States in large part through \"body\nrhythms\" such as stomping, clapping, and patting juba dancing.[56].\nIn the opinion of jazz historian Ernest Borneman, what preceded New Orleans jazz before 1890 was \"Afro-\nLatin music\", similar to what was played in the Caribbean at the time.[57] A three-stroke pattern known in\nCuban music as tresillo is a fundamental rhythmic figure heard in many different slave musics of the\nCaribbean, as well as the Afro-Caribbean folk dances performed in New Orleans Congo Square and\nGottschalk's compositions (for example \"Souvenirs From Havana\" (1859)). Tresillo (shown below) is the\nmost basic and most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-Saharan African music traditions and the\nmusic of the African Diaspora.[58][59]\nTresillo is heard prominently in New Orleans second line music and in other forms of popular music from\nthat city from the turn of the 20th century to present.[60] \"By and large the simpler African rhythmic patterns\nsurvived in jazz ... because they could be adapted more readily to European rhythmic conceptions,\" jazz\nhistorian Gunther Schuller observed. \"Some survived, others were discarded as the Europeanization\nprogressed.\"[61]\nIn the post-Civil War period (after 1865), African Americans were able to obtain surplus military bass drums,\nsnare drums and fifes, and an original African-American drum and fife music emerged, featuring tresillo and\nrelated syncopated rhythmic figures.[62] This was a drumming tradition that was distinct from its Caribbean\ncounterparts, expressing a uniquely African-American sensibility. \"The snare and bass drummers played\nAfrican rhythmic retention\n0:000:00\n/ 0:00/ 0:00", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3245, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bdde9ad-15c4-46c6-a39a-0ea39af30cf3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bdde9ad-15c4-46c6-a39a-0ea39af30cf3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "73f2e36e-fe74-40e5-857b-d5041558797b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "1203bf0b5095a9eb0068c958467c8e8a9ce484ce71b298d4038153a8b996c158", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "syncopated cross-rhythms,\" observed the writer Robert Palmer, speculating that \"this tradition must have\ndated back to the latter half of the nineteenth century, and it could have not have developed in the first place\nif there hadn't been a reservoir of polyrhythmic sophistication in the culture it nurtured.\"[56]\nAfrican-American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban rhythmic motifs in the 19th century when the\nhabanera (Cuban contradanza) gained international popularity.[63] Musicians from Havana and New Orleans\nwould take the twice-daily ferry between both cities to perform, and the habanera quickly took root in the\nmusically fertile Crescent City. John Storm Roberts states that the musical genre habanera \"reached the U.S.\ntwenty years before the first rag was published.\"[64] For the more than quarter-century in which the\ncakewalk, ragtime, and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the habanera was a consistent part of\nAfrican-American popular music.[64]\nHabaneras were widely available as sheet music and were the first written music which was rhythmically\nbased on an African motif (1803).[65] From the perspective of African-American music, the \"habanera\nrhythm\" (also known as \"congo\"),[65] \"tango-congo\",[66] or tango.[67] can be thought of as a combination of\ntresillo and the backbeat.[68] The habanera was the first of many Cuban music genres which enjoyed periods\nof popularity in the United States and reinforced and inspired the use of tresillo-based rhythms in African-\nAmerican music.\nNew Orleans native Louis Moreau Gottschalk's piano piece \"Ojos Criollos (Danse Cubaine)\" (1860) was\ninfluenced by the composer's studies in Cuba: the habanera rhythm is clearly heard in the left hand.[58]: 125  In\nGottschalk's symphonic work \"A Night in the Tropics\" (1859), the tresillo variant cinquillo appears\nextensively.[69] The figure was later used by Scott Joplin and other ragtime composers.\nComparing the music of New Orleans with the music of Cuba, Wynton Marsalis observes that tresillo is the\nNew Orleans \"clav\u00e9\", a Spanish word meaning \"code\" or \"key\", as in the key to a puzzle, or mystery.[70]\nAlthough the pattern is only half a clave, Marsalis makes the point that the single-celled figure is the guide-\npattern of New Orleans music. Jelly Roll Morton called the rhythmic figure the Spanish tinge and considered\nit an essential ingredient of jazz.[71]\nThe abolition of slavery in 1865 led to new opportunities for the education of freed African Americans.\nAlthough strict segregation limited employment opportunities for most blacks, many were able to find work\nin entertainment. Black musicians were able to provide entertainment in dances, minstrel shows, and in\nvaudeville, during which time many marching bands were formed. Black pianists played in bars, clubs, and\nbrothels, as ragtime developed.[72][73]\nRagtime appeared as sheet music, popularized by African-American musicians such as the entertainer Ernest\nHogan, whose hit songs appeared in 1895. Two years later, Vess Ossman recorded a medley of these songs as\na banjo solo known as \"Rag Time Medley\".[74][75] Also in 1897, the white composer William Krell published\nAfro-Cuban influence\n0:000:00\n/ 0:00/ 0:00\n0:000:00\n/ 0:00/ 0:00\nRagtime", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3234, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa4a2f26-8e10-40e5-bc6a-9552e72350b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa4a2f26-8e10-40e5-bc6a-9552e72350b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e825425-0115-49ea-a27e-678464dcb176", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "ebb23e7be9d434a10b3755e2058d5611b3e3d05daf962be6e0e18b2d80727394", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Scott Joplin in 1903\nhis \"Mississippi Rag\" as the first written piano instrumental ragtime piece,\nand Tom Turpin published his \"Harlem Rag\", the first rag published by an\nAfrican-American.\nClassically trained pianist Scott Joplin produced his \"Original Rags\" in 1898\nand, in 1899, had an international hit with \"Maple Leaf Rag\", a multi-strain\nragtime march with four parts that feature recurring themes and a bass line\nwith copious seventh chords.

Handy's music career began in the pre-jazz era and contributed to the codification of\njazz through the publication of some of the first jazz sheet music.\nThe music of New Orleans, Louisiana had a profound effect on the\ncreation of early jazz. In New Orleans, slaves could practice elements\nof their culture such as voodoo and playing drums.[93] Many early\njazz musicians played in the bars and brothels of the red-light district\naround Basin Street called Storyville.[94] In addition to dance bands,\nthere were marching bands which played at lavish funerals (later\ncalled jazz funerals). The instruments used by marching bands and\ndance bands became the instruments of jazz: brass, drums, and reeds\ntuned in the European 12-tone scale. Small bands contained a\ncombination of self-taught and formally educated musicians, many\nfrom the funeral procession tradition. These bands traveled in black communities in the deep south.\nBeginning in 1914, Louisiana Creole and African-American musicians played in vaudeville shows which\ncarried jazz to cities in the northern and western parts of the U.S.[95] Jazz became international in 1914, when\nthe Creole Band with cornettist Freddie Keppard performed the first ever jazz concert outside the United\nStates, at the Pantages Playhouse Theatre in Winnipeg, Canada.[96]\nIn New Orleans, a white bandleader named Papa Jack Laine integrated blacks and whites in his marching\nband. He was known as \"the father of white jazz\" because of the many top players he employed, such as\nGeorge Brunies, Sharkey Bonano, and future members of the Original Dixieland Jass Band. During the early\n1900s, jazz was mostly performed in African-American and mulatto communities due to segregation laws.\nStoryville brought jazz to a wider audience through tourists who visited the port city of New Orleans.[97]\nMany jazz musicians from African-American communities were hired to perform in bars and brothels. These\nincluded Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton in addition to those from other communities, such as Lorenzo\nTio and Alcide Nunez.

According to Mario Dunkel,\nWhiteman's success was based on a \"rhetoric of domestication\" according to which he had elevated and\nrendered valuable (read \"white\") a previously inchoate (read \"black\") kind of music.[117]\nWhiteman's success caused black artists to follow suit, including Earl\nHines (who opened in The Grand Terrace Cafe in Chicago in 1928),\nWashington, D.C.-native Duke Ellington (who opened at the Cotton\nClub in Harlem in 1927), Lionel Hampton, Fletcher Henderson,\nClaude Hopkins, and Don Redman, with Henderson and Redman\ndeveloping the \"talking to one another\" formula for \"hot\" swing\nmusic.[118]\nIn 1924, Louis Armstrong joined the Fletcher Henderson dance band\nfor a year, as featured soloist. By 1924, one of Armstrong's favorite\n\"Sweet Jazz\" Big bands was also formed in Canada by Guy\nLombardo. His Royal Canadians Orchestra specialized in\nperformances of \"the Sweetest music this side of Heaven\" which\ntranscended racial boundaries.[119][120] The original New Orleans\nstyle was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong was a\nmaster of his hometown style, but by the time he joined Henderson's band, he was already a trailblazer in a\nnew phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong's solos went well beyond the\ntheme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by\ncomparison, the solos by Armstrong's bandmates (including a young Coleman Hawkins), sounded \"stiff,\nstodgy\", with \"jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality\".[121] The following example shows a\nshort excerpt of the straight melody of \"Mandy, Make Up Your Mind\" by George W. Meyer and Arthur\nJohnston (top), compared with Armstrong's solo improvisations (below) (recorded 1924).[122] Armstrong's\nsolos were a significant factor in making jazz a true 20th-century language. After leaving Henderson's group,\nArmstrong formed his Hot Five band, where he popularized scat singing.[123]\nThe 1930s belonged to popular swing big bands, in which some\nvirtuoso soloists became as famous as the band leaders. Key figures in\ndeveloping the \"big\" jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers\nCount Basie, Cab Calloway, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Duke\nEllington, Benny Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Harry\nJames, Jimmie Lunceford, Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw.

In the\n1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big\nbands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues\nused small combos, uptempo music and blues chord progressions, drawing on boogie-woogie from the\n1930s.\nWhile swing was reaching the height of its popularity, Duke Ellington spent\nthe late 1920s and 1930s in Washington, D.C.'s jazz scene, developing an\ninnovative musical idiom for his orchestra. Abandoning the conventions of\nswing, he experimented with orchestral sounds, harmony, and musical form\nwith complex compositions that still translated well for popular audiences;\nsome of his tunes became hits, and his own popularity spanned from the\nUnited States to Europe.[124]\nEllington called his music American Music, rather than jazz, and liked to\ndescribe those who impressed him as \"beyond category\".[125] These included\nmany musicians from his orchestra, some of whom are considered among the\nbest in jazz in their own right, but it was Ellington who melded them into one\nof the most popular jazz orchestras in the history of jazz. He often composed\nfor the style and skills of these individuals, such as \"Jeep's Blues\" for Johnny\nHodges, \"Concerto for Cootie\" for Cootie Williams (which later became \"Do Nothing Till You Hear from\nMe\" with Bob Russell's lyrics), and \"The Mooche\" for Tricky Sam Nanton and Bubber Miley. He also\nrecorded compositions written by his bandsmen, such as Juan Tizol's \"Caravan\" and \"Perdido\", which\nbrought the \"Spanish Tinge\" to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained with him for\nseveral decades. The band reached a creative peak in the early 1940s, when Ellington and a small hand-\npicked group of his composers and arrangers wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed\ntremendous creativity.[126]\nAs only a limited number of American jazz records were released in Europe, European jazz traces many of\nits roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, and Lonnie Johnson, who visited\nEurope during and after World War I. It was their live performances which inspired European audiences'\ninterest in jazz, as well as the interest in all things American (and therefore exotic) which accompanied the\neconomic and political woes of Europe during this time.[127] The beginnings of a distinct European style of\njazz began to emerge in this interwar period.\nBritish jazz began with a tour by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919. In 1926, Fred Elizalde and His\nCambridge Undergraduates began broadcasting on the BBC. Thereafter jazz became an important element in\nmany leading dance orchestras, and jazz instrumentalists became numerous.[128]\nThis style entered full swing in France with the Quintette du Hot Club de France, which began in 1934.\nMuch of this French jazz was a combination of African-American jazz and the symphonic styles in which\nFrench musicians were well-trained; in this, it is easy to see the inspiration taken from Paul Whiteman since\nhis style was also a fusion of the two.[129] Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt popularized gypsy jazz, a mix\nThe influence of Duke Ellington\nBeginnings of European jazz", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3592, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c4da77f-325e-42de-8635-e6c38e1acc3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c4da77f-325e-42de-8635-e6c38e1acc3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41b9c28d-a2bc-4ca9-bf9a-94ef2ff566c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "436cf9aa76d4e532914119b3e29d3136ceadf04478300e66d5d006acdfab1bef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The \"classic quintet\": Charlie Parker,\nTommy Potter, Miles Davis, Dizzy\nGillespie, and Max Roach\nperforming at Three Deuces in New\nYork City.

The\nswing-era jazz of the previous decade had challenged other popular\nmusic as being representative of the nation's culture, with big bands\nreaching the height of the style's success by the early 1940s; swing\nacts and big bands traveled with U.S. military overseas to Europe,\nwhere it also became popular.[132] Stateside, however, the war\npresented difficulties for the big-band format: conscription shortened\nthe number of musicians available; the military's need for shellac\n(commonly used for pressing gramophone records) limited record\nproduction; a shortage of rubber (also due to the war effort)\ndiscouraged bands from touring via road travel; and a demand by the\nmusicians' union for a commercial recording ban limited music\ndistribution between 1942 and 1944.[133]\nMany of the big bands who were deprived of experienced musicians\nbecause of the war effort began to enlist young players who were\nbelow the age for conscription, as was the case with saxophonist Stan\nGetz's entry in a band as a teenager.[134] This coincided with a\nnationwide resurgence in the Dixieland style of pre-swing jazz;\nperformers such as clarinetist George Lewis, cornetist Bill Davison,\nand trombonist Turk Murphy were hailed by conservative jazz critics\nas more authentic than the big bands.[133] Elsewhere, with the\nlimitations on recording, small groups of young musicians developed\na more uptempo, improvisational style of jazz,[132] collaborating and experimenting with new ideas for\nmelodic development, rhythmic language, and harmonic substitution, during informal, late-night jam\nsessions hosted in small clubs and apartments. Key figures in this development were largely based in New\nYork and included pianists Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, drummers Max Roach and Kenny Clarke,\nsaxophonist Charlie Parker, and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie.[133] This musical development became known as\nbebop.[132]\nBebop and subsequent post-war jazz developments featured a wider set of notes, played in more complex\npatterns and at faster tempos than previous jazz.[134] According to Clive James, bebop was \"the post-war\nmusical development which tried to ensure that jazz would no longer be the spontaneous sound of joy ...\nStudents of race relations in America are generally agreed that the exponents of post-war jazz were\ndetermined, with good reason, to present themselves as challenging artists rather than tame entertainers.\"[135]\nThe end of the war marked \"a revival of the spirit of experimentation and musical pluralism under which it\nhad been conceived\", along with \"the beginning of a decline in the popularity of jazz music in America\",\naccording to American academic Michael H.

Other younger\nperformers, such as singer Big Joe Turner and saxophonist Louis Jordan, who were discouraged by bebop's\nincreasing complexity, pursued more lucrative endeavors in rhythm and blues, jump blues, and eventually\nrock and roll.[132] Some, including Gillespie, composed intricate yet danceable pieces for bebop musicians in\nan effort to make them more accessible, but bebop largely remained on the fringes of American audiences'\npurview. \"The new direction of postwar jazz drew a wealth of critical acclaim, but it steadily declined in\npopularity as it developed a reputation as an academic genre that was largely inaccessible to mainstream\naudiences\", Burchett said. \"The quest to make jazz more relevant to popular audiences, while retaining its\nartistic integrity, is a constant and prevalent theme in the history of postwar jazz.\"[132] During its swing\nperiod, jazz had been an uncomplicated musical scene; according to Paul Trynka, this changed in the post-\nwar years:\nSuddenly jazz was no longer straightforward.

From now on it was\nno good saying that you liked jazz, you had to specify what kind of jazz. And that is the way it has\nbeen ever since, only more so. Today, the word 'jazz' is virtually meaningless without further\ndefinition.[134]\nIn the early 1940s, bebop-style performers began to shift jazz from danceable popular music toward a more\nchallenging \"musician's music\". The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker,\npianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer\nMax Roach. Divorcing itself from dance music, bebop established itself more as an art form, thus lessening\nits potential popular and commercial appeal.\nComposer Gunther Schuller wrote: \"In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it and all\nthose other great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and\nsubstitutions and Dizzy Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was 'bop'\nand the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings.\"[136]\nDizzy Gillespie wrote: \"People talk about the Hines band being 'the incubator of bop' and the leading\nexponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the\nmusic was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The\ndifference was in how you got from here to here to here...naturally each age has got its own shit.\"[137]\nSince bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it could use faster tempos. Drumming shifted to a\nmore elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time while the snare and bass\ndrum were used for accents. This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity.[138]\nBebop musicians employed several harmonic devices which were not previously typical in jazz, engaging in\na more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation.

I couldn't play it...I was working over 'Cherokee,' and, as I did, I found that by using\nthe higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could\nplay the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive.\"[141] Gerhard Kubik postulates that harmonic development in\nbebop sprang from blues and African-related tonal sensibilities rather than 20th-century Western classical\nmusic. \"Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker's] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the\nblues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories. Bebop musicians\neliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the\nblues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices.\"[141]\nSamuel Floyd states that blues was both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about a new\nharmonic conception using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic\nvariety, a developed and even more highly syncopated, linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity\nin which the blue note of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic-harmonic device; and\nreestablishment of the blues as the primary organizing and functional principle.[138] Kubik wrote:\nWhile for an outside observer, the harmonic innovations in bebop would appear to be inspired by\nexperiences in Western \"serious\" music, from Claude Debussy to Arnold Schoenberg, such a\nscheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did\nhave some influence on jazz, for example, on Bix Beiderbecke's piano playing. And it is also\ntrue that Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European\ncontemporary music. West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool\njazz, but bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary,\nideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by\na desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas\ntransmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western\nharmonic approach. The ultimate significance of all this is that the experiments in jazz during the\n1940s brought back to African-American music several structural principles and techniques\nrooted in African traditions.[142]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3615, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5323aae5-82c7-42da-b11b-388bc621424f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5323aae5-82c7-42da-b11b-388bc621424f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dccdc96e-e724-4981-bc4b-94224e39a85a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "cea591ccf81594dbb835567684dbfc34d490ab0f06b8ce056e701011d262654d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Machito (maracas) and his\nsister Graciella Grillo\n(claves)\nDizzy Gillespie, 1955\nThese divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time met a divided, sometimes hostile response among\nfans and musicians, especially swing players who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics,\nbebop seemed filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\".[143] But despite the friction, by the 1950s bebop had\nbecome an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary.\nThe general consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first\noriginal jazz piece to be overtly based in clave was \"Tanga\" (1943), composed\nby Cuban-born Mario Bauza and recorded by Machito and his Afro-Cubans in\nNew York City. \"Tanga\" began as a spontaneous descarga (Cuban jam\nsession), with jazz solos superimposed on top.[144]\nThis was the birth of Afro-Cuban jazz. The use of clave brought the African\ntimeline, or key pattern, into jazz. Music organized around key patterns\nconvey a two-celled (binary) structure, which is a complex level of African\ncross-rhythm.[145] Within the context of jazz, however, harmony is the\nprimary referent, not rhythm. The harmonic progression can begin on either\nside of clave, and the harmonic \"one\" is always understood to be \"one\". If the progression begins on the\n\"three-side\" of clave, it is said to be in 3\u20132 clave (shown below). If the progression begins on the \"two-side\",\nit is in 2\u20133 clave.[146]\nMario Bauz\u00e1 introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban conga\ndrummer and composer Chano Pozo. Gillespie and Pozo's brief collaboration\nproduced some of the most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards. \"Manteca\"\n(1947) is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According\nto Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal guajeos (Afro-Cuban\nostinatos) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the\nbridge. Gillespie recounted: \"If I'd let it go like [Chano] wanted it, it would\nhave been strictly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn't have been a bridge.\nI thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but ... I had to keep going and\nended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge.\"[147] The bridge gave \"Manteca\" a\ntypical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauza's modal\n\"Tanga\" of a few years earlier.\nGillespie's collaboration with Pozo brought specific African-based rhythms\ninto bebop.

The\ncross noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes).\nWhen John Coltrane covered \"Afro Blue\" in 1963, he inverted the metric hierarchy, interpreting the tune as a\n3 4  jazz waltz with duple cross-beats superimposed (2:3). Originally a B\u266d  pentatonic blues, Coltrane expanded\nthe harmonic structure of \"Afro Blue\".\nPerhaps the most respected Afro-cuban jazz combo of the late 1950s was vibraphonist Cal Tjader's band.\nTjader had Mongo Santamaria, Armando Peraza, and Willie Bobo on his early recording dates.\nIn the late 1940s, there was a revival of Dixieland, harking back to the contrapuntal New Orleans style. This\nwas driven in large part by record company reissues of jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong\nbands of the 1930s. There were two types of musicians involved in the revival: the first group was made up\nof those who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style and were returning to it (or continuing\nwhat they had been playing all along), such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and\nWild Bill Davison.[152] Most of these players were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small\nnumber of New Orleans musicians involved. The second group of revivalists consisted of younger musicians,\nsuch as those in the Lu Watters band, Conrad Janis, and Ward Kimball and his Firehouse Five Plus Two Jazz\nBand. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s\nand 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan,\nalthough critics paid little attention to it.[152]\n\"Un Poco Loco\"\nAfrican cross-rhythm\nDixieland revival\nHard bop", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2790, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "593942b2-6045-4235-9e01-ea596ee5a32b": {"__data__": {"id_": "593942b2-6045-4235-9e01-ea596ee5a32b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d50bc880-ba18-49ac-b84b-948ede2d81b6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "657b8968a9d6c559a9df583602203194beb36057d9a6671a4b01694aadebfade", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Art Blakey (1973)\nHard bop is an extension of bebop (or \"bop\") music that incorporates\ninfluences from blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel, especially in\nsaxophone and piano playing. Hard bop was developed in the mid-\n1950s, coalescing in 1953 and 1954; it developed partly in response to\nthe vogue for cool jazz in the early 1950s and paralleled the rise of\nrhythm and blues. It has been described as \"funky\" and can be\nconsidered a relative of soul jazz.[153] Some elements of the genre\nwere simplified from their bebop roots.[154]\nMiles Davis' 1954 performance of \"Walkin'\" at the first Newport Jazz\nFestival introduced the style to the jazz world.[155] Further leaders of hard bop's development included the\nClifford Brown/Max Roach Quintet, Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, the Horace Silver Quintet, and\ntrumpeters Lee Morgan and Freddie Hubbard. The late 1950s to early 1960s saw hard boppers form their\nown bands as a new generation of blues- and bebop-influenced musicians entered the jazz world, from\npianists Wynton Kelly and Tommy Flanagan[156] to saxophonists Joe Henderson and Hank Mobley. Coltrane,\nJohnny Griffin, Mobley, and Morgan all participated on the album A Blowin' Session (1957), considered by\nAl Campbell to have been one of the high points of the hard bop era.[157]\nHard bop was prevalent within jazz for about a decade spanning from 1955 to 1965,[156] but has remained\nhighly influential on mainstream[154] or \"straight-ahead\" jazz. It went into decline in the late 1960s through\nthe 1970s due to the emergence of other styles such as jazz fusion, but again became influential following the\nYoung Lions Movement and the emergence of neo-bop.[154]\nModal jazz is a development which began in the later 1950s which takes the mode, or musical scale, as the\nbasis of musical structure and improvisation. Previously, a solo was meant to fit into a given chord\nprogression, but with modal jazz, the soloist creates a melody using one (or a small number of) modes. The\nemphasis is thus shifted from harmony to melody:[158] \"Historically, this caused a seismic shift among jazz\nmusicians, away from thinking vertically (the chord), and towards a more horizontal approach (the\nscale)\",[159] explained pianist Mark Levine.\nThe modal theory stems from a work by George Russell. Miles Davis introduced the concept to the greater\njazz world with Kind of Blue (1959), an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz which would become\nthe best selling jazz album of all time. In contrast to Davis' earlier work with hard bop and its complex chord\nprogression and improvisation, Kind of Blue was composed as a series of modal sketches in which the\nmusicians were given scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style.[160]\n\"I didn't write out the music for Kind of Blue, but brought in sketches for what everybody was supposed to\nplay because I wanted a lot of spontaneity,\"[161] recalled Davis. The track \"So What\" has only two chords: D-\n7 and E\u266d -7.[162]\nOther innovators in this style include Jackie McLean,[163] and two of the musicians who had also played on\nKind of Blue: John Coltrane and Bill Evans.\nModal jazz\nFree jazz", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3160, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43243d54-4983-44fa-8aa2-e567491dfea1": {"__data__": {"id_": "43243d54-4983-44fa-8aa2-e567491dfea1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "724b0c42-dc6e-444b-9472-276982524f5c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "b611c04a02cc1d9064de88f90c4d971e69fc291dc3626f2f55bd316989963928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "John Coltrane, 1963\nFree jazz, and the related form of avant-garde jazz, broke through into an\nopen space of \"free tonality\" in which meter, beat, and formal symmetry all\ndisappeared, and a range of world music from India, Africa, and Arabia were\nmelded into an intense, even religiously ecstatic or orgiastic style of\nplaying.[164] While loosely inspired by bebop, free jazz tunes gave players\nmuch more latitude; the loose harmony and tempo was deemed controversial\nwhen this approach was first developed. The bassist Charles Mingus is also\nfrequently associated with the avant-garde in jazz, although his compositions\ndraw from myriad styles and genres.\nThe first major stirrings came in the 1950s with the early work of Ornette\nColeman (whose 1960 album Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation coined\nthe term) and Cecil Taylor. In the 1960s, exponents included Albert Ayler,\nGato Barbieri, Carla Bley, Don Cherry, Larry Coryell, John Coltrane, Bill\nDixon, Jimmy Giuffre, Steve Lacy, Michael Mantler, Sun Ra, Roswell Rudd,\nPharoah Sanders, and John Tchicai. In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the\ndissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray, a rhythm section honed\nwith Cecil Taylor as leader. In November 1961, Coltrane played a gig at the Village Vanguard, which resulted\nin the classic Chasin' the 'Trane, which DownBeat magazine panned as \"anti-jazz\". On his 1961 tour of\nFrance, he was booed, but persevered, signing with the new Impulse! Records in 1960 and turning it into \"the\nhouse that Trane built\", while championing many younger free jazz musicians, notably Archie Shepp, who\noften played with trumpeter Bill Dixon, who organized the 4-day \"October Revolution in Jazz\" in Manhattan\nin 1964, the first free jazz festival.\nA series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming\nincreasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like multiphonics, utilization of overtones, and\nplaying in the altissimo register, as well as a mutated return to Coltrane's sheets of sound. In the studio, he all\nbut abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone. In addition, the quartet responded to the\nleader by playing with increasing freedom. The group's evolution can be traced through the recordings The\nJohn Coltrane Quartet Plays, Living Space and Transition (both June 1965), New Thing at Newport (July\n1965), Sun Ship (August 1965), and First Meditations (September 1965).\nIn June 1965, Coltrane and 10 other musicians recorded Ascension, a 40-minute-long piece without breaks\nthat included adventurous solos by young avant-garde musicians as well as Coltrane, and was controversial\nprimarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. Dave Liebman later called it \"the\ntorch that lit the free jazz thing\". After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited\nPharoah Sanders to join the band in September 1965. While Coltrane used over-blowing frequently as an\nemotional exclamation-point, Sanders would opt to overblow his entire solo, resulting in a constant\nscreaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument.\nFree jazz was played in Europe in part because musicians such as Ayler, Taylor, Steve Lacy, and Eric Dolphy\nspent extended periods of time there, and European musicians such as Michael Mantler and John Tchicai\ntraveled to the U.S. to experience American music firsthand.

A more precise term might be Afro-Latin jazz, as the jazz subgenre\ntypically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa or exhibit\nan African rhythmic influence beyond what is ordinarily heard in other jazz. The two main categories of\nLatin jazz are Afro-Cuban jazz and Brazilian jazz.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, many jazz musicians had only a basic understanding of Cuban and Brazilian music,\nand jazz compositions which used Cuban or Brazilian elements were often referred to as \"Latin tunes\", with\nno distinction between a Cuban son montuno and a Brazilian bossa nova. Even as late as 2000, in Mark\nGridley's Jazz Styles: History and Analysis, a bossa nova bass line is referred to as a \"Latin bass figure\".[166]\nIt was not uncommon during the 1960s and 1970s to hear a conga playing a Cuban tumbao while the drumset\nand bass played a Brazilian bossa nova pattern. Many jazz standards such as \"Manteca\", \"On Green Dolphin\nStreet\" and \"Song for My Father\" have a \"Latin\" A section and a swung B section. Typically, the band would\nonly play an even-eighth \"Latin\" feel in the A section of the head and swing throughout all of the solos. Latin\njazz specialists like Cal Tjader tended to be the exception. For example, on a 1959 live Tjader recording of\n\"A Night in Tunisia\", pianist Vince Guaraldi soloed through the entire form over an authentic mambo.[167]\nFor most of its history, Afro-Cuban jazz had been a matter of superimposing jazz phrasing over Cuban\nrhythms. But by the end of the 1970s, a new generation of New York City musicians had emerged who were\nfluent in both salsa dance music and jazz, leading to a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms.\nThis era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry (congas and trumpet) and\nAndy (bass).[168] During 1974\u20131976, they were members of one of Eddie Palmieri's most experimental salsa\ngroups: salsa was the medium, but Palmieri was stretching the form in new ways. He incorporated parallel\nfourths, with McCoy Tyner-type vamps. The innovations of Palmieri, the Gonzalez brothers and others led to\nan Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance in New York City.\nThis occurred in parallel with developments in Cuba[169] The first Cuban band of this new wave was Irakere.\nTheir \"Ch\u00e9kere-son\" (1976) introduced a style of \"Cubanized\" bebop-flavored horn lines that departed from\nthe more angular guajeo-based lines which were typical of Cuban popular music and Latin jazz up until that\ntime.

The following pentatonic lick was played over blues\nchanges by Joe Henderson on Horace Silver's \"African Queen\" (1965).[180]\nJazz pianist, theorist, and educator Mark Levine refers to the scale generated by beginning on the fifth step of\na pentatonic scale as the V pentatonic scale.[181]\nC pentatonic scale beginning on the I (C pentatonic), IV (F pentatonic), and\nV (G pentatonic) steps of the scale.\nLevine points out that the V pentatonic scale works for all three chords of the standard II\u2013V\u2013I jazz\nprogression.[182] This is a very common progression, used in pieces such as Miles Davis' \"Tune Up\".

Secular jazz musicians often performed renditions of spirituals and hymns as part of\ntheir repertoire or isolated compositions such as \"Come Sunday\", part of \"Black and Beige Suite\" by Duke\nEllington. Later many other jazz artists borrowed from black gospel music. However, it was only after World\nWar II that a few jazz musicians began to compose and perform extended works intended for religious\nsettings or as religious expression. Since the 1950s, sacred and liturgical music has been performed and\nrecorded by many prominent jazz composers and musicians.[186] The \"Abyssinian Mass\" by Wynton\nMarsalis (Blueengine Records, 2016) is a recent example.\nRelatively little has been written about sacred and liturgical jazz. In a 2013 doctoral dissertation, Angelo\nVersace examined the development of sacred jazz in the 1950s using disciplines of musicology and history.\nHe noted that the traditions of black gospel music and jazz were combined in the 1950s to produce a new\ngenre, \"sacred jazz\".[187] Versace maintained that the religious intent separates sacred from secular jazz. Most\nprominent in initiating the sacred jazz movement were pianist and composer Mary Lou Williams, known for\nher jazz masses in the 1950s and Duke Ellington. Prior to his death in 1974 in response to contacts from\nGrace Cathedral in San Francisco, Duke Ellington wrote three Sacred Concerts: 1965 \u2013 A Concert of Sacred\nMusic; 1968 \u2013 Second Sacred Concert; 1973 \u2013 Third Sacred Concert.\nThe most prominent form of sacred and liturgical jazz is the jazz mass. Although most often performed in a\nconcert setting rather than church worship setting, this form has many examples. An eminent example of\ncomposers of the jazz mass was Mary Lou Williams. Williams converted to Catholicism in 1957, and\nproceeded to compose three masses in the jazz idiom.[188] One was composed in 1968 to honor the recently\nassassinated Martin Luther King Jr. and the third was commissioned by a pontifical commission. It was\nperformed once in 1975 in St Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. However the Catholic Church has not\nembraced jazz as appropriate for worship. In 1966 Joe Masters recorded \"Jazz Mass\" for Columbia Records.\nA jazz ensemble was joined by soloists and choir using the English text of the Roman Catholic Mass.[189]\nOther examples include \"Jazz Mass in Concert\" by Lalo Schiffrin (Aleph Records, 1998, UPC\n0651702632725) and \"Jazz Mass\" by Vince Guaraldi (Fantasy Records, 1965). In England, classical\ncomposer Will Todd recorded his \"Jazz Missa Brevis\" with a jazz ensemble, soloists and the St Martin's\nVoices on a 2018 Signum Records release, \"Passion Music/Jazz Missa Brevis\" also released as \"Mass in\nBlue\", and jazz organist James Taylor composed \"The Rochester Mass\" (Cherry Red Records, 2015).[190] In\n2013, Versace put forth bassist Ike Sturm and New York composer Deanna Witkowski as contemporary\nexemplars of sacred and liturgical jazz.[187]\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the hybrid form of jazz-rock fusion was developed by combining jazz\nimprovisation with rock rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound of rock musicians\nsuch as Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa. Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters, odd time signatures,\nsyncopation, complex chords, and harmonies.\nAccording to AllMusic:\nSacred and liturgical jazz\nJazz fusion", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3700, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5672cd7-dfd8-4dfd-ac97-3e9ebaf334d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5672cd7-dfd8-4dfd-ac97-3e9ebaf334d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e50bcf3c-bd94-4ced-88fd-51ceb59c87e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "25bf8e73351ce7d50b3b9dcbfb877644df11723496d383ce5ccc36de2ef741f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Fusion trumpeter Miles Davis in\n1989\n... until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were\nnearly completely separate.

Composed of two side-long suites\nedited heavily by producer Teo Macero, this quiet, static album would be equally influential to the\ndevelopment of ambient music.\nAs Davis recalls:\nThe music I was really listening to in 1968 was James Brown, the great guitar player Jimi\nHendrix, and a new group who had just come out with a hit record, \"Dance to the Music\", Sly\nand the Family Stone ... I wanted to make it more like rock. When we recorded In a Silent Way I\njust threw out all the chord sheets and told everyone to play off of that.[192]\nTwo contributors to In a Silent Way also joined organist Larry Young to create one of the early acclaimed\nfusion albums: Emergency!

The album featured a softer sound than would be the case\nin later years (predominantly using acoustic bass with Shorter exclusively playing soprano saxophone, and\nwith no synthesizers involved), but is still considered a classic of early fusion. It built on the avant-garde\nexperiments which Joe Zawinul and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on Bitches Brew, including an\navoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favor of continuous rhythm and movement \u2013 but took the\nmusic further. To emphasize the group's rejection of standard methodology, the album opened with the\ninscrutable avant-garde atmospheric piece \"Milky Way\", which featured by Shorter's extremely muted\nsaxophone inducing vibrations in Zawinul's piano strings while the latter pedaled the instrument. DownBeat\ndescribed the album as \"music beyond category\", and awarded it Album of the Year in the magazine's polls\nthat year.\nWeather Report's subsequent releases were creative funk-jazz works.[193]\nMiles Davis' new directions\nPsychedelic-jazz\nWeather Report\nJazz-rock", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2552, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fae9c3fd-bb2f-4fd4-955c-cacee164ab01": {"__data__": {"id_": "fae9c3fd-bb2f-4fd4-955c-cacee164ab01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5a8101b8-6bd4-4150-bd50-ff865b2d9368", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "eea3541bc99fd1f38cbde50025438c55f289923a0a38bedd97607c1c0212222d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Although some jazz purists protested against the blend of jazz and rock, many jazz innovators crossed over\nfrom the contemporary hard bop scene into fusion. As well as the electric instruments of rock (such as\nelectric guitar, electric bass, electric piano and synthesizer keyboards), fusion also used the powerful\namplification, \"fuzz\" pedals, wah-wah pedals and other effects that were used by 1970s-era rock bands.\nNotable performers of jazz fusion included Miles Davis, Eddie Harris, keyboardists Joe Zawinul, Chick\nCorea, and Herbie Hancock, vibraphonist Gary Burton, drummer Tony Williams, violinist Jean-Luc Ponty,\nguitarists Larry Coryell, Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, Ryo Kawasaki, and Frank Zappa, saxophonist\nWayne Shorter and bassists Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke. Jazz fusion was also popular in Japan, where\nthe band Casiopea released more than thirty fusion albums.\nAccording to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, \"just as free jazz appeared on the verge of creating a whole new\nmusical language in the 1960s ... jazz-rock briefly suggested the promise of doing the same\" with albums\nsuch as Williams' Emergency! (1970) and Davis' Agharta (1975), which Nicholson said \"suggested the\npotential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite\napart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before.\" This development was stifled by\ncommercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre \"mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that\neventually took up residence on FM radio\" at the end of the 1970s.[194]\nAlthough jazz-rock fusion reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s, the use of electronic instruments\nand rock-derived musical elements in jazz continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Musicians using this approach\ninclude Pat Metheny, John Abercrombie, John Scofield and the Swedish group e.s.t. Since the beginning of\nthe 1990s, electronic music had significant technical improvements that popularized and created new\npossibilities for the genre. Jazz elements such as improvisation, rhythmic complexities and harmonic textures\nwere introduced to the genre and consequently had a big impact in new listeners and in some ways kept the\nversatility of jazz relatable to a newer generation that did not necessarily relate to what the traditionalists call\nreal jazz (bebop, cool and modal jazz).[195] Artists such as Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Flying Lotus and sub\ngenres like IDM, drum 'n' bass, jungle and techno ended up incorporating a lot of these elements.[196]\nSquarepusher being cited as one big influence for jazz performers drummer Mark Guiliana and pianist Brad\nMehldau, showing the correlations between jazz and electronic music are a two-way street.[197]\nBy the mid-1970s, the sound known as jazz-funk had developed, characterized by a strong back beat\n(groove), electrified sounds[198] and, often, the presence of electronic analog synthesizers. Jazz-funk also\ndraws influences from traditional African music, Afro-Cuban rhythms and Jamaican reggae, notably\nKingston bandleader Sonny Bradshaw. Another feature is the shift of emphasis from improvisation to\ncomposition: arrangements, melody and overall writing became important. The integration of funk, soul, and\nR&B music into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is wide and ranges from strong jazz\nimprovisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs and jazz solos, and sometimes soul\nvocals.[199]\nEarly examples are Herbie Hancock's Headhunters band and Miles Davis' On the Corner album, which, in\n1972, began Davis' foray into jazz-funk and was, he claimed, an attempt at reconnecting with the young\nblack audience which had largely forsaken jazz for rock and funk.

Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis\nemerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what\nhe believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and\ncreating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by\nartists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, as well as the\nhard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and\ncommercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against\nFusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz\npioneered in the 1960s (particularly modal jazz and post-bop);\nnonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of\ntraditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and\nevolve.\nFor example, several musicians who had been prominent in the fusion genre during the 1970s began to\nrecord acoustic jazz once more, including Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock. Other musicians who had\nexperimented with electronic instruments in the previous decade had abandoned them by the 1980s; for\nexample, Bill Evans, Joe Henderson, and Stan Getz. Even the 1980s music of Miles Davis, although certainly\nstill fusion, adopted a far more accessible and recognizably jazz-oriented approach than his abstract work of\nthe mid-1970s, such as a return to a theme-and-solos approach.\nA similar reaction took place against free jazz. According to Ted Gioia:\nthe very leaders of the avant garde started to signal a retreat from the core principles of free jazz.\nAnthony Braxton began recording standards over familiar chord changes. Cecil Taylor played\nduets in concert with Mary Lou Williams, and let her set out structured harmonies and familiar\njazz vocabulary under his blistering keyboard attack. And the next generation of progressive\nplayers would be even more accommodating, moving inside and outside the changes without\nthinking twice. Musicians such as David Murray or Don Pullen may have felt the call of free-\nform jazz, but they never forgot all the other ways one could play African-American music for\nfun and profit.[200]\nPianist Keith Jarrett\u2014whose bands of the 1970s had played only original compositions with prominent free\njazz elements\u2014established his so-called 'Standards Trio' in 1983, which, although also occasionally\nexploring collective improvisation, has primarily performed and recorded jazz standards. Chick Corea\nsimilarly began exploring jazz standards in the 1980s, having neglected them for the 1970s.\nIn 1987, the United States House of Representatives and Senate passed a bill proposed by Democratic\nRepresentative John Conyers Jr. to define jazz as a unique form of American music, stating \"jazz is hereby\ndesignated as a rare and valuable national American treasure to which we should devote our attention,\nsupport and resources to make certain it is preserved, understood and promulgated.\" It passed in the House\non September 23, 1987, and in the Senate on November 4, 1987.[201]\nStraight-ahead jazz", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3329, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0a1ae1c-6304-490e-9032-6d88020d42a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0a1ae1c-6304-490e-9032-6d88020d42a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "904fb64f-d13a-4f7a-a010-ca536610265a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "ff36d9332282108b1907f3a44fe5c0adf522a3c242d5c0633a8e72c55222bcd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In 2001, Ken Burns's documentary Jazz premiered on PBS, featuring Wynton Marsalis and other experts\nreviewing the entire history of American jazz to that time.

In the 1970s, the groups of Betty Carter and\nArt Blakey and the Jazz Messengers retained their conservative jazz approaches in the midst of fusion and\njazz-rock, and in addition to difficulty booking their acts, struggled to find younger generations of personnel\nto authentically play traditional styles such as hard bop and bebop. In the late 1970s, however, a resurgence\nof younger jazz players in Blakey's band began to occur. This movement included musicians such as Valery\nPonomarev and Bobby Watson, Dennis Irwin and James Williams.

These younger\nrising stars rejected avant-garde approaches and instead championed the acoustic jazz sound of Charlie\nParker, Thelonious Monk and early recordings of the first Miles Davis quintet. This group of \"Young Lions\"\nsought to reaffirm jazz as a high art tradition comparable to the discipline of classical music.[202]\nIn addition, Betty Carter's rotation of young musicians in her group foreshadowed many of New York's\npreeminent traditional jazz players later in their careers. Among these musicians were Jazz Messenger alumni\nBenny Green, Branford Marsalis and Ralph Peterson Jr., as well as Kenny Washington, Lewis Nash, Curtis\nLundy, Cyrus Chestnut, Mark Shim, Craig Handy, Greg Hutchinson and Marc Cary, Taurus Mateen and Geri\nAllen.

It ranges from the combination of\nlive instrumentation with the beats of jazz house (as exemplified by St Germain, Jazzanova, and Fila\nBrazillia) to more band-based improvised jazz with electronic elements (for example, The Cinematic\nOrchestra, Kobol and the Norwegian \"future jazz\" style pioneered by Bugge Wesseltoft, Jaga Jazzist, and\nNils Petter Molv\u00e6r).\nJazz rap developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and incorporates jazz influences into hip hop. In 1988,\nGang Starr released the debut single \"Words I Manifest\", which sampled Dizzy Gillespie's 1962 \"Night in\nTunisia\", and Stetsasonic released \"Talkin' All That Jazz\", which sampled Lonnie Liston Smith. Gang Starr's\ndebut LP No More Mr. Nice Guy (1989) and their 1990 track \"Jazz Thing\" sampled Charlie Parker and\nRamsey Lewis. The groups which made up the Native Tongues Posse tended toward jazzy releases: these\ninclude the Jungle Brothers' debut Straight Out the Jungle (1988), and A Tribe Called Quest's People's\nInstinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (1990) and The Low End Theory (1991). Rap duo Pete Rock &\nCL Smooth incorporated jazz influences on their 1992 debut Mecca and the Soul Brother. Rapper Guru's\nJazzmatazz series began in 1993 using jazz musicians during the studio recordings.\nAlthough jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, Miles Davis' final album Doo-Bop (released\nposthumously in 1992) was based on hip hop beats and collaborations with producer Easy Mo Bee. Davis'\nex-bandmate Herbie Hancock also absorbed hip-hop influences in the mid-1990s, releasing the album Dis Is\nDa Drum in 1994.\nThe mid-2010s saw an increased influence of R&B, hip-hop, and pop music on jazz. In 2015, Kendrick\nLamar released his third studio album, To Pimp a Butterfly. The album heavily featured prominent\ncontemporary jazz artists such as Thundercat[207] and redefined jazz rap with a larger focus on improvisation\nand live soloing rather than simply sampling. In that same year, saxophonist Kamasi Washington released his\nAcid jazz, nu jazz, and jazz rap", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3372, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d26fc083-c6ed-4e5f-b6d1-4851cd3825c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d26fc083-c6ed-4e5f-b6d1-4851cd3825c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34964faa-95a3-4ba0-8dd6-8ecec8704e03", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "1d599f416b5bb27936d8320186d12fddf935d79ae65376246efa0fda88c942e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "John Zorn performing in\n2006\nSteve Coleman in Paris, July 2004\nnearly three-hour long debut, The Epic. Its hip-hop inspired beats and R&B vocal interludes was not only\nacclaimed by critics for being innovative in keeping jazz relevant,[208] but also sparked a small resurgence in\njazz on the internet.\nThe relaxation of orthodoxy which was concurrent with post-punk in London\nand New York City led to a new appreciation of jazz. In London, the Pop\nGroup began to mix free jazz and dub reggae into their brand of punk\nrock.[209] In New York, No Wave took direct inspiration from both free jazz\nand punk. Examples of this style include Lydia Lunch's Queen of Siam,[210]\nGray, the work of James Chance and the Contortions (who mixed Soul with\nfree jazz and punk)[210] and the Lounge Lizards[210] (the first group to call\nthemselves \"punk jazz\").\nJohn Zorn took note of the emphasis on speed and dissonance that was\nbecoming prevalent in punk rock, and incorporated this into free jazz with the\nrelease of the Spy vs. Spy album in 1986, a collection of Ornette Coleman\ntunes done in the contemporary thrashcore style.[211] In the same year, Sonny\nSharrock, Peter Br\u00f6tzmann, Bill Laswell, and Ronald Shannon Jackson\nrecorded the first album under the name Last Exit, a similarly aggressive\nblend of thrash and free jazz.[212] These developments are the origins of\njazzcore, the fusion of free jazz with hardcore punk.\nThe M-Base movement started in the 1980s, when a loose collective\nof young African-American musicians in New York which included\nSteve Coleman, Greg Osby, and Gary Thomas developed a complex\nbut grooving[213] sound.\nIn the 1990s, most M-Base participants turned to more conventional\nmusic, but Coleman, the most active participant, continued\ndeveloping his music in accordance with the M-Base concept.[214]\nColeman's audience decreased, but his music and concepts influenced\nmany musicians, according to pianist Vijay Iver and critic Ben Ratlifff\nof The New York Times.[215][216]\nM-Base changed from a movement of a loose collective of young musicians to a kind of informal Coleman\n\"school\",[217] with a much advanced but already originally implied concept.[218] Steve Coleman's music and\nM-Base concept gained recognition as \"next logical step\" after Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, and Ornette\nColeman.[219]\nSince the 1990s, jazz has been characterized by a pluralism in which no one style dominates, but rather a\nwide range of styles and genres are popular. Individual performers often play in a variety of styles,\nsometimes in the same performance.

The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music. A\nfirm avant-garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players, such as saxophonists Greg Osby\nand Charles Gayle, while others, such as James Carter, have incorporated free jazz elements into a more\ntraditional framework.\nHarry Connick Jr. began his career playing stride piano and the\nDixieland jazz of his home, New Orleans, beginning with his first\nrecording when he was 10 years old.[220] Some of his earliest lessons\nwere at the home of pianist Ellis Marsalis.[221] Connick had success\non the pop charts after recording the soundtrack to the movie When\nHarry Met Sally, which sold over two million copies.[220] Crossover\nsuccess has also been achieved by Diana Krall, Norah Jones,\nCassandra Wilson, Kurt Elling, and Jamie Cullum.\nAdditionally, the era saw the release of recordings and videos from\nthe previous century, such as a Just Jazz tape broadcast by a band led\nby Gene Ammons[222] and studio archives such as Just Coolin' by Art\nBlakey and the Jazz Messengers.[223]\nAn internet-aided trend of 2010's jazz was that of extreme reharmonization, inspired by both virtuosic\nplayers known for their speed and rhythm such as Art Tatum, as well as players known for their ambitious\nvoicings and chords such as Bill Evans. Supergroup Snarky Puppy adopted this trend, allowing players like\nCory Henry[224] to shape the grooves and harmonies of modern jazz soloing. YouTube phenomenon Jacob\nCollier also gained recognition for his ability to play an incredibly large number of instruments and his\nability to use microtones, advanced polyrhythms, and blend a spectrum of genres in his largely homemade\nproduction process.[225][226]\nOther jazz musicians gained popularity through social media during the 2010s and 2020s. These included\nJoan Chamorro, a bassist and bandleader based in Barcelona whose big band and jazz combo videos have\nreceived tens of millions of views on YouTube,[227] and Emmet Cohen, who broadcast a series of\nperformances live from New York starting in March 2020.[228]\nJazz portal\nMusic portal\nUnited States\nportal\nJazz (Henri Matisse)\nJazz piano\nJazz royalty\nVictorian Jazz Archive\nHogan Jazz Archive\nInternational Jazz Day\nSocial media\nSee also", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2479, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55c368ea-eefc-40a7-9278-d57c2825c18f": {"__data__": {"id_": "55c368ea-eefc-40a7-9278-d57c2825c18f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "887038ce-9626-41be-8901-1f5eab2dbe9f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Jazz.pdf"}, "hash": "754f2e2be30b06b890a2291bf14ecf22eab05571a09d29c5e6a7dde18d818c8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Bibliography of jazz\nTimeline of jazz education\nList of certified jazz recordings\nList of jazz festivals\nList of jazz genres\nList of jazz musicians\nList of jazz standards\nList of jazz venues\nList of jazz venues in the United States\n1.
